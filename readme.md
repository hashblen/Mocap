Mocap
=====
EchebKeso's mocap mod updated to 1.8.9. need Mocap-core 1.8.9 from my other repo in the libs folder.

Note: To build, you need to add a compiled "Mocap-core" jar to the "libs" folder and reference the JAR in your Eclipse/etc setup.
Additionally for easier debugging, place "mocap-core-stub.jar" in your eclipse/mods folder to auto-load the Mocap core during debugging.
